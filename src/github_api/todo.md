# Workflow

* Get all the repos <br/><br/>
    Either through `repos.async_list_public` and manually select the "right" ones
    OR use `search` <br/><br/>
    If one were to use `search`, its rate limit is 1800 req/hour, while `repos.async_list` has 5000 req/hour.
    `search` is limited in how many repos it can return: 4000 max. Maybe one can overcome this by using the exact number of stars in the request (for stars=100 get all the repos; increase stars, ...) (more than 4000 repos with the same number of stars?) <br/><br/>
    Overall, `search` seems to be better suited for the job, despite having limitations: I bet the number of repos with stars less than, say 100, is far more greater, than the difference in `search` and `repos.async_list` performance. <br/><br/>
    If one wants to use `repos.async_list` to look at each of the repos (300 000 000), it would take ~600 hours with one requester. **Solution**: to have 600 requesters :thumbsup: <br/><br/>
